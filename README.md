Running Locally
---------------
To run locally, you will an "environment.json" file in the project root directory. This file should contain the basic
credentials to connect to a mongodb server. Once this is set up, you can run the API server locally by running the
following command:

```sh
cd api-node ; make
```

You can then access the app at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

-----
- Finish contribution prototype
- Persist model
- Handle invalid state entry points
